# AI: The good, the bad, the ugly
 The prevalance of AI in our society has brought many things into society, both good and bad. Whilst AI might pose some serious benefits for us, the disadvantages of a rogue AI must be considered before we bring it to the mainstream. 
## Advantages 
 AI has many applications in the information age, such as:
 - advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search)
 - recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix)
 - understanding human speech
 
 As AI is used in more and more applications, tasks that originally required *intelligence* are removed from the definition of AI.
